            <h2>~ About Me ~</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Ridhi Kalsi, and I am a passionate tech and web development enthusiast. I have a keen interest in
               exploring the latest technologies and trends in the web development world. From building dynamic websites to diving deep
               into coding languages, I love every aspect of creating and optimizing web experiences.
               My journey in the tech world began when i started to feel the increasing easiness in life due to web applications and
               got a slight chance in creating one of the applications which made me more interested in this field, and since then,
               I've been dedicated to honing my skills and expanding my knowledge. Whether it's front-end design or back-end development,
               I enjoy tackling new challenges and finding innovative solutions.
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am always eager to learn and stay updated with the ever-evolving tech landscape.
               I believe that continuous learning is key to staying ahead in this field, and I make it a point to participate in 
               workshops, webinars, and online courses.I am excited about the future of web development and look forward to contributing
               to this dynamic and ever-changing industry.</p>
